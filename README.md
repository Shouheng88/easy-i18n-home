**This software is designed to solve the challenges of multilingual management in software development and operations.**

This project is developed based on Kotlin Multiplatform, supporting MacOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Features

In the past, when maintaining multilingual terms, modifying a single term might require searching through multiple localization files. Easy I18n cleverly consolidates the editing of these terms into a single dialog for more convenient operation. Key features include:

- Load and display multilingual terms with intuitive presentation and quick operations
- Support for deleting and modifying terms, with write-back to localization files
- Support for automatic translation
- Support for multiple development platforms: Android, iOS, Flutter, Compose, Java, etc.
- Support for keyword search and filtering of multilingual terms
- And more...

This project is open source, and we welcome you to contribute code or suggestions! 🎉
